							When faced with intense domestic turmoil, governments may strategically engage in foreign interactions to divert the public’s attention away from pressing domestic issues. I test this hypothesis for a globally representative sample of 195
							countries, at the monthly level, over the years 1997-2017. Using textual data on
							media–reported events retrieved from the GDELT database, I find robust evidence
							that governments resort to diversionary tactics in times of domestic turmoil and that
							such diversion takes the form of verbally aggressive foreign interactions, typically
							targeted at ‘weak’ countries and countries closely linked along religious, linguistic
							and geographic dimensions. Strategically important trade partners are unlikely to
							be victimized. These findings suggest that diversionary foreign policy is, in fact,
							systematically practised by governments as a strategic tool, and that such diversion
							is exercised in a manner that may not lead to large scale costs or risks of retaliation.

							  <div class="item-desc">The aggregate economic impact of any project depends on its effects within the
								chosen administrative region as well as its economic spillovers into other regions.
								However, little is known about how these spillovers propagate through geographic,
								ethnic and road networks. In this paper, we analyze both theoretically and empirically the role of these networks in the spatial diffusion of local economic shocks. We
								develop a network model that shows how a district’s level of prosperity is related to
								its position in the network. The network model’s first-order conditions are used to
								derive an econometric model of spatial spillovers that we estimate using a panel of
								5,944 districts from 53 African countries over the period 1997–2013. To identify the
								causal effect of spatial diffusion, we exploit cross-sectional variation in the location
								of mineral mines and exogenous time variation in world mineral prices. Our results
								show that road and ethnic connectivity are particularly important factors for diffusing economic spillovers over longer distances. We then use the estimated parameters
								from the econometric model to calculate the key player centralities, which determine which districts are key in propagating local economic shocks across Africa. We
								further show how counterfactual exercises based on these estimates and the underlying network structure can inform us about the potential gains from policies that
								increase economic activity in specific districts or improve road connectivity between
								districts.<br>

							  We develop a network model of conflict in which players are involved in different battles. A negative shock in one locality affects the conflict in this locality but may also increase battles in path-connected localities depending on the location of the battle in the network and the strength of each locality involved in each battle. We then empirically test this model by analyzing the effect of local natural disasters on battles in Africa. We construct a novel panel-dataset that combines geo-referenced information about battle events and natural disasters at the monthly level for 5,944 districts in 53 African countries over the period from 1989 to 2015. At this fine temporal and spatial resolution, natural disasters are formidable exogenous shocks that affect the costs and benefits of fighting in a locality. We find that natural disasters decrease battle incidence in the affected locality and that this effect persists over time and space. This mitigating effect appears to be more pronounced in more developed localities. As highlighted by the model, these results can be explained by the fact that natural disasters divert fighting activity to surrounding localities, particularly those that are connected via geographic and road networks.
